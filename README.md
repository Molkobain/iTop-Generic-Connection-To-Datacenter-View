# iTop-Generic-Connection-To-Datacenter-View
Just a very small extension to complete Generic-Connection with Molkobain's Datacenter View

# Goal

This is a tiny extension, just adding some fields of Molkobain's [DatacenterView extension](https://github.com/Molkobain/itop-datacenter-view) in my own [iTop-Generic-Connection extension](https://github.com/Schirrms/iTop-Generic-Connection).

# Dependencies

Of course, this extension can only be installed on a system with :

- Molkobain's DatacenterView >= 1.5.1
- iTop-Generic-Connection >= 0.7.2

# Installation

As for all my extensions, just download the zip file, and copy the 'schirrms-...' directory in your extensions directory, then rerun the setup as usual.
